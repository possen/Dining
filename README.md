# Dining
A project that demonstrates interactive animating view controllers to display a restaurant's reservation. It is purely a sample app so some of the views are just dummy views with nothing in them and it has some rough edges. It will display the view using view effects

In addition to demonstrating the animating view controller. It also has a TableViewAdapter pattern that avoids the massive view controller, and that TableViewAdaptor supports multiple cell types and only minor configuration when the view is loaded. The TableViewAdaptor is designed to be reused and is not just for this one instance.
