• Only run on iPhone SE For some reason the simulator shows animation on SE but not iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+

• Overall Approach keep the view controllers small, typically these become quite large with many responsibilities and become unmanagable. You can see this by adopting the Adaptor pattern for the tableView.

• Adhere to the single responsibility principle. Where each object does one thing and one thing only as much as possible

• Try to utilize type system, I did run into problems with "Type Erasing" and ths caused a delay

• I wanted to get the Banner Controller Animation to work better but I left this to last. I can keep working on it.

• Updates occur for UI on main thread.


• should support different devices such as iPad, iPhone 6+, and iPhone. Handles size classes as appropriate. Although I did notice some issues in iPad version.

• THe highlighted text is implmente but not visible.

• Pull to refresh works to bring up the next set of data.

• THe interactive animation is triggered by pulling down on the close button (but is not wokring very well right now).

• Needs more unit tests.
